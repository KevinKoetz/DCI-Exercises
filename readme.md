* Anagram
 * Definition:- A word is an anagram of another word if they are using the same
 * letters with the same quantity, but arranged differently.
 * 
 * write a function that checks if two provided strings are anagrams of each other;
 * letter casing shouldnâ€™t matter. 
 * Also, consider only characters, not spaces or punctuation. For Example:
 * anagram('fried','fired') // true;
 * anagram('gainly', 'lying') //true;
 * anagram('listen', 'bye')  // false; (bearbeitet)
